# Gooey

[Javadocs](https://mccreery.github.io/gooey/) (wip)

Gooey is a Java library providing reusable geometry and layout components. Its
original intention was to decouple these components from the [Better
HUD](https://github.com/mccreery/better-hud) codebase. Gooey is not dependent on
Better HUD or Minecraft Forge.

See the associated [GitHub
project](https://github.com/mccreery/gooey/projects/1) to see progress.
